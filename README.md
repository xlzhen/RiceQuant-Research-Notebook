# RiceQuant-Research-Notebook
This repository aims to test (hopefully realize) research ideas on liquid investment strategy from XBZ on Chinese stock martkets (namely Shanghai stock exchange and Shenzhen stock exchange) via RiceQuant platform.

Our idea is based on the assumption of tremendous social influences on individual stock investors' buy/sell behavior on short-term investment comparing to long-term investment. 

History stock data is pulled from RiceQuant platform through its internal API.
